          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My journey into technology began at <b>NIT Rourkela</b>, where I was
            introduced to a new and exciting environment that sparked my
            curiosity. I started by building a strong foundation with
            <b> Competitive Programming</b>, <b>Data Structures & Algorithms</b>,
            and also explored the world of <b>Web Development</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it was in my third year that I was introduced to{" "}
            <b>AI and Machine Learning</b>, and I have been hooked ever since. I
            find the field incredibly interesting and am deeply passionate about
            its potential to solve complex problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            This passion led me to an internship at <b>Quantiphi</b>, where I
            truly put my ability as a quick learner to the test. I was tasked
            with challenging projects in <b>NLP</b>, <b>Computer Vision</b>, and{" "}
            <b>Time Series</b>, all with tight deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience was instrumental, proving my ability to not only
            apply existing knowledge but also to <b>learn fast</b> and deliver
            results under pressure. I am now eager to bring that same energy,
            passion, and problem-solving ability to a new role.
